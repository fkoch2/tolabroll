tolabroll.py will duplicate the column "Name" to "Labroll" in any number of Avid Bins and will save you approximately 7 minutes of work.

How to use it:
1) Make sure your python3 is up to date
2) Make sure to install the dependencies, namely the pyavb library by Mark Reid, by running `pip install -r /path/to/tolabroll_requirements.txt`
3) Clone this repository
4) `python3 tolabroll.py path/to/bin1 path/to/bin2....`
